Features
Real-time emotion detection from video input.

Backend API for emotion prediction.

User-friendly React.js interface.

Technologies Used
Backend
Python 3.9: Programming language.

Uvicorn: ASGI server for running the FastAPI application.

FastAPI: Web framework for building the API.

Emotions-Recognition: Library for emotion detection (likely based on deep learning models).

Frontend
React.js: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

npm: Package manager for JavaScript.

Setup and Installation
Follow these steps to set up and run the Emotion Detector application on your local machine.

Backend
Navigate to the backend directory:

cd backend

Create a virtual environment:
It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

python -m venv .venv

Activate the virtual environment:

On Windows:

.venv\Scripts\activate

On macOS/Linux:

source .venv/bin/activate

Install backend dependencies:
Install the required Python packages from requirements.txt.

pip install -r requirements.txt

Install the Emotion Recognition library:
This library is sourced directly from a GitHub repository.

pip install https://github.com/AmrElsersy/Emotions-Recognition/tree/master

Frontend
Navigate to the frontend directory:
Assuming your frontend code is in the root of the repository or a frontend subdirectory. If it's in the root, you might skip this cd command or adjust it.

# If your frontend is in a 'frontend' directory:
cd ../frontend
# If your frontend is in the root of the repository, you might not need to change directory.

(Please adjust the cd command if your frontend is not in a frontend subdirectory relative to the backend.)

Install frontend dependencies:

npm install

Running the Application
Start the Backend Server
Ensure your virtual environment is activated (if you've closed your terminal, navigate back to the backend directory and reactivate it).

Run the Uvicorn server:

uvicorn server:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload

The backend server will typically run on http://0.0.0.0:8000 (or http://127.0.0.1:8000). The --reload flag enables hot-reloading for development.

Start the Frontend Development Server
Ensure you are in the frontend directory.

Start the React development server:

npm start

This will usually open the application in your default web browser at http://localhost:3000 (or another available port).

Usage
Once both the backend and frontend servers are running, open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 (or the port indicated by npm start). The application should now be accessible, allowing you to interact with the emotion detection features.

(Further details on how to use the application, e.g., "Click the 'Start Camera' button to begin emotion detection," can be added here.)
